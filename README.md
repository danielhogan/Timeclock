Timeclock
==================
When the app opens, the user will be entered into the current date in a calender format. The month shown will be the 
current month.
The user can tap on any day of the week, or month, including the month name to choose a month from the year,
as with a normal windows calender. Can choose the year to go back or forward to any year between 2000 and 2099.
When a day is clicked, the user will be (if there is no information in it already), into a window with a few input
boxes available. Times will be in scroll format, like with setting an event on a calender app.
Hours will be 1-12, minutes will be 00-59. Am/Pm as well.

Also allow for edit function, as well as a 'Add another shift for this day' type of option, just in case that
someone pulls a double or a triple shift.


There will also be an 8th column named "Total hours", which will add up the total hours that you work for that week 
and output them.

On top of the 7 days in the week, and the 8th column, there will also be an 9th column. It will be placed on the right 
side of Saturday. 
This column will show the hours paid totaled up. Will also say at top "Total paid hours"

The user will also have the option to set their 'pay date'. When the 'set pay date' option is selected, the top will 
output: "When is your next pay day?" and The user can click on a day. It will ask to confirm it, and upon yes,
It will ask, "How often is your pay?" With options of 'Daily','Weekly', Biweekly', and 'Monthly'.


There will also be an 'about' section that explains what the program does, how to use it, and if there are bugs or issues,
they can send to my email (djhogan44@gmail.com)
